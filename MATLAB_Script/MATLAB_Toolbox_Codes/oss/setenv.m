%SETENV Set environment variable.
%  SETENV(NAME, VALUE) sets the value of an environment variable belonging
%  to the underlying operating system. Inputs NAME and VALUE are both
%  string scalars or character vectors. If NAME already exists as an
%  environment variable, then SETENV replaces its current value with the
%  character vector or string scalar given in VALUE. If NAME does not
%  exist, SETENV creates a new environment variable called NAME and assigns
%  VALUE to it.
%
%  SETENV(NAME) is equivalent to SETENV(NAME, '') and assigns a 
%  null value to the variable NAME. Under the Windows operating 
%  system, this is equivalent to undefining the variable.  On most
%  UNIX-like platforms, it is possible to have an environment 
%  variable defined as empty.
%  
%  The maximum number of characters in NAME is 2^15 - 2 (or 32766).
%  If NAME contains the character '=', SETENV throws an error. 
%  The behavior of environment variables with '=' in the name is 
%  not well-defined.
%
%  On all platforms, SETENV passes the NAME and VALUE to the operating
%  system unchanged. Special characters such as ';', '/', ':', '$', '%',
%  etc. are left unexpanded and intact in the variable value.
%  
%  Values assigned to variables using SETENV are picked up by any
%  process that is spawned using the MATLAB SYSTEM, UNIX, DOS or '!' 
%  functions. You can retrieve any value set with SETENV by using
%  GETENV(NAME).
%
%  Examples :
%    % Set a new value for the environment variable TEMP:
%    setenv('TEMP', 'C:\TEMP');
%    getenv('TEMP')
%
%    % Append the Perl\bin directory to your system PATH variable:
%    setenv('PATH', [getenv('PATH') ';D:\Perl\bin']);
