# A RobotState consisting of hint/seed positions for the IK computation. 
# These may be used to seed the IK search. 
# The seed state MUST contain state for all joints to be used by the IK solver
# to compute IK. The list of joints that the IK solver deals with can be found using
# the kinematics_msgs/GetKinematicSolverInfo

# Additional state information can be provided here to specify the starting positions 
# of other joints/links on the robot.
